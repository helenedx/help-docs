Androy Pay (former called Google Wallet) is a platform Google released for integrate
payments in the Android devices. It is being released since 2015 and soon will be available
worldwide.

For those that already use wallets solutions based on the `pkpass` format defined by Apple
for its *Wallet* App, there are some differences that should be pointed out before start
using it.

The platform consist in two basic features, `Payments` and `Passes`, the first one allow you
to use you device (equiped with some NFC component) for making payments by registering
your bank cards into it. The second allow you to install passes (Coupons, Membership Cards, etc)
into yours device's wallet.

> At the `Passworks` platform only the feature for `Passes` is used.
